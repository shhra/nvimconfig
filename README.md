# A Basic configuration for Neovim.

Modified from: [nvim-basic-ide](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide)

The original repo promised several IDE features. However, I do not want IDE features. What I want is a text editor that loads fast from the terminal. The whole purpose of this configuration is to optimize code browsing.

The window management, as well as buffer management, will be optimized with idea that nvim exists to browse code base and change files quickly. 


## Changes

1. Remove aesthetics.
2. Remove DAP.
3. Remove git changes.
4. Remove terminal.
5. Improve focus on code browsing/editing.
6. Most of the original items are kept as it is. 


## More changes to come

- [ ] Improve window management
- [ ] Improve code traversal
- [ ] Improve buffer management


# The Goal

1. To be able to clone it into any server and instantly be able to change minor configurations and fix errors directly at the server code.
2. Clone a repo, browse the code and see how things work. 
3. Apply minor edits without having to deal with IDEs and their shenanigans.
